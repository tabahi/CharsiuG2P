Text -> the words CharsiuG2P is fed.

The model is a WORD g2p: one word in, one IPA string out. For a space-delimited
script `split_words` is all that is needed. For a script that does not put
spaces between words (lang_codes.NEEDS_WORD_SEGMENTATION_ISO) it hands the
model whole clauses, and the output is IPA-shaped noise, so those languages go
through a segmenter instead. `segment(text, lang)` picks the right path;
everything that turns text into words should call it.

Only the standard library is imported here, so a data loader can use
`split_words` without the segmenter packages. Each segmenter is imported the
first time its language is segmented.

Each language has exactly ONE backend. "Use whichever package happens to be
installed" would give the same corpus different labels on different machines.

The backends were chosen by running the model, not by counting how many
segmented words are keys of dicts/<tag>.tsv. That count rewards splitting
into the model's training words, and for Thai, Khmer and Burmese those splits
change the pronunciation: the whole word is read correctly, its pieces are
not (see each section below). The test sets were FLEURS dev for Thai, and a
dozen everyday and news sentences per language, written for this purpose,
for the rest.

#
# The coverage column is misleading. tha.tsv has only 13.6k entries, so newmm
# emits compounds the model never saw (ออกเสียง, หลีกเลี่ยง), and restricting
# it to tha.tsv splits them back into training words. We ran the model on the
# 448 compound types that the restriction splits. For 94 of them (21%) the
# parts do not concatenate to the whole, and the whole is the correct one:
#
#   พุทธศาสนา  whole pʰut̚.tʰa.saːt̚.sa.naː  parts pʰut̚ | saːt̚.sa.naː  (linking vowel lost)
#   บุช        whole but̚                   parts buʔ | t͡ɕʰɔː           (ช read as a letter name)
#
# ICU makes the same kind of cut and also cuts through syllables
# (เป็นก|ลุ่ม for เป็น|กลุ่ม). So newmm is used unrestricted, with two repairs:
#
# - A boundary inside a TCC is always wrong. newmm's nine such boundaries all
#   come before a thanthakhat (ไน|ต์, เซน|ไท|น์ in loanwords), and a lone ต์
#   comes back from the model as a pronounced letter. Such tokens are merged
#   back together.
# - ๆ (mai yamok) is expanded (see `_expand_repeat`). It was the most frequent
#   out-of-dictionary token (75).
